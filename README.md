Not really sure what this is but here I go. The purpose of the Map Tool Draft, also known as the Service Area Tool, is to create a javascript applet can be used in our platform to allow BidList users to create and update their service territory. 
The features of this tool include an open source mapping tool called Leaflet, along with a custom UI for creating different layers to store geospatial territory data along with pricing adders that would be used to determine how a contractor's pricing changes depending on the location of a project.
