Not really sure what this is but here I go. The purpose of the Map Tool Draft, also known as the Service Area Tool, is to create a javascript plugin that users in the BidList platform can use to create and update their service territory. 
The features of this tool include an open source mapping tool called Leaflet, along with a custom UI for creating different layers to store geospatial territory data along with pricing adders that would be used to determine how a contractor's pricing changes dpeending on the location of a project.
